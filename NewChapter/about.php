                <p>Established in August 2022, New Chapter is a company that aims to give used books a second chance.
                    Instead of recyling them along with newspapers where they will eventually be torn apart, these books are to be collected and resold at reasonable prices.
                    The name "New Chapter" represents the starting of a new chapter in the life of the used books,
                    and the word "Chapter" in this name relates to the chapters in a book.
                    Hence, when people come across the company's name "New Chapter", they could link it to the meaning and purpose behind it.
                    New Chapter is established by a young entrepreneur who loves reading since young but always had the issue of not having enough space to store his old books.
                    Not wanting these books to go to waste, he decided to start a business in reselling them.
                    He had no intention of earning any profit and wanted to help the community as well,
                    therefore all money earned from this business will be given to charity.

                <p>Even though the transition to electronic books has been growing rapidly in this era,
                    there are still many people out there that prefer reading printed books,
                    the feeling of being able to touch them and flip them from one page to another cannot simply be replaced by electronic books.
                    However, as more books start to pile up, thinking of where to keep these books or what to do with them can be a headache,
                    as chances are not all the books will be reread.
                    Furthermore, not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to afford printed books,
                    these readers have lesser opportunities as compared to others.
                    To overcome the aforementioned problems, New Chapter has started this business in the hopes to reduce the issue of too many books as well as enable more people to purchase a variety of books at lower prices.
                    Many books can be given another opportunity to have a new owner, starting a new chapter in the books' lives.
                    The joy of reading can be spread to people of different backgrounds,
                    not to forget the profit earned from the sales of these used books which can help contribute to the betterment of the society.
